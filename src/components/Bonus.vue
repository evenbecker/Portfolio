      <h4 class="verdanaH">Linux as a desktop OS</h4>
      <p> Linux works well on server. However on desktop, there are more things to consider: multimedia codecs, Wi-Fi
        drivers, GPU drivers (possible screen tearing/stuttering/flickering), CPU microcode, printers drivers, ...
        Problems may happen. Never expect popular distros to make things work out-of-the-box as they pretend to do.
        Better study the configuration files and CLI utilities by reading the <a
          href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page">Arch wiki</a> or the Gentoo wiki. A good Linux user doesn't
        need GUI system configuration tools besides the installer.<br> Opinions about bloat are divided. Security
        experts think that complex software is prone to vulnerabilities. Some pieces of software contain tremendous
        amounts of totally unnecessary attack surface and follows poor security practices. In addition, new features can
        increase the attack surface and introduce a large amount of new bugs. <a
          href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.en.html">FSF-approved</a> Trisquel GNU/Linux gives a good idea
        about what to avoid. Trisquel doesn't have a Gnome edition, so I don't use Gnome. I use a stacking window
        manager. One big advantage of window managers is to be able to run apps of different desktop environments
        without any stability/performance loss. Here are some of the tools I use:</p>

      <p>My opinion on some Linux distros:</p>
      <p> <span class="colored"><b>Ubuntu : </b></span> Too much bloat preinstalled. Snap has terrible bloat. Telemetry
        is probably increasing. Some Ubuntu derivatives don't come with Snap: Bodhi Linux, Pop!_OS and Linux Mint for
        example. It may change.
      </p>
      <p><span class="colored"><b>Fedora Workstation :</b></span> A user-friendly net installer called 'Everything
        installer' is available since 2025. Fedora has a strict policy of including only open source software in its
        official repositories... but there is a lot of non-free firmware/drivers preinstalled. Fedora is therefore not
        FSF-approved. There is also telemetry since Fedora 42.</p>
      <p id="kinoite">Silverblue/Kinoite: minimalistic but it's not suitable for everybody because updates are delivered
        as full images. That's time consuming and disk space consuming. Flatpak apps are recommended to keep the image
        small, but Flatpak apps have more issues (bugs and audio or storage permissions problems). Here is a quote from
        a devs chat: <q>Flatpak doesnâ€™t allow important parts of the Chromium sandbox to work as it should. Chromium
          browsers and Electron apps distributed on Flathub all rely on a 3rd-party package called Zypak to trick
          Chromium into thinking its SUID sandbox is present.
        </q></p>
      <p><span class="colored"><b>Manjaro :</b></span> Unsigned packages from time to time. More and more bloat and
        telemetry.
      </p>
      <p><span class="colored"><b>Debian :</b></span> No bloat but outdated software, especially browsers. No graphical
        minimal installer, only a CLI installer. Some Debian derivatives have a graphical minimal installer, namely
        PeppermintOS and Q4OS.
      </p>
      <p id="kinoite">Debian testing: The debian testing branch can move very fast and many users have broken their
        system. Security patches are not immediately available. The unstable branch is more secure.</p>
      <p><span class="colored"><b>MX Linux :</b></span> Not so bloated. Latest firefox available. It's like Debian++ to
        me. Very good distro.
      </p>
      <p><span class="colored"><b>OpenSUSE Tumbleweed :</b></span> Zypper is slower and less reliable than dnf. Many
        Tumbleweed users have to use Flatpak because OpenSUSE multimedia codec repos are messy and can lead to
        dependencies issues. Packman repo is maintained by external people who don't follow SUSE policy. Some Packman
        RPMs might be malicious.
      </p>
      <p><span class="colored"><b>Arch Linux :</b></span> No bloat. Bleeding edge, so unstability might come from update
        to update, namely broken glibc and kernel panic at boot. It's generally fixed after 2-3 days. Tip: dual boot
        Arch with a stable rescue distro to remain operational during these days.
      </p>
      <p><span class="colored"><b>KaOS :</b></span> No bloat, user-friendly, more stable than Arch Linux. Downside: it's
        only for KDE users, no kernels choice, limited software choice, not enough mirrors.
      </p>
      <p><span class="colored"><b>Void Linux:</b></span> No bloat, more stable than Arch Linux. The xbps tools are
        amazing. Use xbps-src and git to locally install/update packages like Brave browser. Very good distro.
      </p>
      <p><span class="colored"><b>Gentoo :</b></span> Source-based distro, no bloat, more stable than Arch Linux. It
        takes time to build packages. Better use Gentoo with a window manager like icewm to build quickly. Not suitable
        for users who need to quickly install big software like libreoffice and chromium.
